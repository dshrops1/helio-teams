    So using no frame work we are going to build our own module based spa
    using div tags that we inject our dynamically created html into
    and then we will hide or show those divs if they are supposed to be there
  -->
  <!--in fact we should have a createNewComponent method that creates our div
    then we will have a render method where we inject all needed code
    so maybe pass an object or string with all the html
    maybe the render takes a string and just sets the inner html
